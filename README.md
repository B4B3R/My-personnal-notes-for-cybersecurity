    A month ago, I finished all the tier 0 of HackTheBox Starting Point and half of the tier 1 (I stopped at the machine Three)
    I will store all my notes in this repo and organize each section, if you want you are free to download my notes (do not hesitate to make me pull requests if you have any problem on a notion I address or you         find things wrong in my notes). Being a debutant from today I will try to be as active as possible on my github to be able to achieve my goals. If you are still reading this note already thank you and letâ€™s         start the adventure.
    Now I'll have to pwned the machine Three on HTB.
